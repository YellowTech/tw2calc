# tw2calc (Tribal Wars 2 Calculator) using React

A little tool I wrote for some friends than enables easy attack time calculations for multiple villages.

The calculator can be used at https://tw2calc.yellowtech.ch/

To run it yourself, clone the repo and run the react project using ```yarn start``` or ```npm start``` when node or yarn is installed.
